Hi there, I'm Lisi, a Theoretical Systems Biologist and Maschinenlehrerin. I form part of the <a href="https://www.theosysbio.com">Theoretical Systems Biology Group</a> led by Michael P.H. Stumpf.
  Our group is located at Imperial College London and at the University of Melbourne.
  I started in the group as a MSc Student at Imperial College London; After my graduation, I became a PhD Student at University of Melbourne.<br><br>
  <!-- The biological focus of our current team lies on understanding and contolling the cell fate decision making process. -->
  Prior to joining Michael's group,
  I was lucky enough to gain my first research insigns whist being a BSc student in Bioinformatics at the Technical University Munich and the Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich (2014-2017).
  During this time I got to visit the <a href="https://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/icb/research/groups/marr-lab/overview/index.html">Quantitative Single Cell Dynamics Group</a> led by Carsten Marr at the Helmholtz Centre Munich,
  and in the <a href="https://www.biochem.mpg.de/cox">Computational Systems Biochemistry Group </a> of Juergen Cox at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry in Munich.<br><br>
