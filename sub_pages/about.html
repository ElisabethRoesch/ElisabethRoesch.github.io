<h2>Hello, World! </h2>
<p>
  I'm Lisi, a Theoretical Systems Biologist and Maschinenlehrerin.
  The main objective of my work is to solve biological problems by developing and applying mathematicical, statistical and computational models.
</p>
<p>
  Since 2018, I form part of the Theoretical Systems Biology group led by Michael P.H. Stumpf.
  Our group is located at Imperial College London and at the University of Meblourne.
  I started in the group as a MSc Student at Imperial College London; After my graduation, I became a PhD Student at University of Meblourne.
  The biological focus of our current team lies on understanding and contolling the cell fate decision making process.

  Prior to joining Michael's group,
  I was lucky engough to gain my first research insigns whist being a BSc student in Bioinformatics at the Technical University Munich and the Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich.
  During this time (2014-2017) I spent some time in the Single Cell Dynamics Group led by Carsten Marr at the Helmholtz Centre Munich,
  and in the Computational Systems Biochemistry group of Juergen Cox at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry in Munich.
