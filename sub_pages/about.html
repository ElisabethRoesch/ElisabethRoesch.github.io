<h2>Hello, World! </h2>
<p>
  I'm Lisi, a Theoretical Systems Biologist and Maschinenlehrerin.
  The main objective of my work is to solve biological problems by developing and applying mathematicical, statistical and computational models.
  To give you a rough idea on what I've been up to over the last years, here is a little time line.
  For more details you can check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elisabeth-roesch-35328a181/">LinkedIn</a> or you can reach me via <a href="mailto:eroesch@student.unimelb.edu.au">email</a> for a full cv.

  <b>PhD: 2018 - dato</b>    Since 2018, I form part of the Theoretical Systems Biology group led by Michael P.H. Stumpf.
  Our group is located at Imperial College London and at the University of Meblourne.<br>
  Currently, I am a PhD Student at University of Meblourne (School of Mathematics and Statistics).
  In my PhD, I focus my research on hybrid models, in which we combine approaches of mechanistic and data-driven modeling techniques. h
  Recently, I've joint forces with Chris Rackauckas (MIT) to work on training methods of neural differential equations (You can watch a talk I gave about this work on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1ikOmEuM8w&t=1526s">youtube</a>).
</p>

<p>
  <b>MSc: 2017 - 2018</b> Before moving to Meblourne, I started in the Theoretical Systems Biology group at Imperial College London where I graduated with a MSc in Bioinformatics and Theoretical Systems Biology.
  It was during this time that I started getting more and more interested in Bayesian Inference methods and differential equation models in Systems Biology.
  The fundermentals for my work on bifurcations I learnt and discovered here (I made a <a href="https://github.com/ElisabethRoesch/Bifurcations/blob/master/ER_Poster.pdf">poster</a> about this).
</p>

<p>
  <b>BSc: 2014 - 2017</b> Prior to joining Michael's group,
  I was lucky engough to gain my first research insigns whist being a BSc student in Bioinformatics at the Technical University Munich and the Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich.
  During this time I spent some time
  in the Single Cell Dynamics Group led by Carsten Marr at the Helmholtz Centre Munich,and
  in the Computational Systems Biochemistry group of Juergen Cox at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry in Munich.
  Here, I implemented my first machine learning alogrithms for the classification of breast cancer from proteomic data.
